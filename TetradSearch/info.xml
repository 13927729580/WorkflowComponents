<abstract>The <b>search box</b> takes as input a data set (in either a data or simulation box) and optionally a knowledge box, and searches for causal explanations represented by directed graphs. The result of a search is not necessarily—and not usually—a unique graph, but an object such as a pattern that represents a set of graphs, usually a Markov Equivalence class. More alternatives can be found by varying the parameters of search algorithms.
