<abstract>Four models that add time or memory strength to a logistic regression over the "error rate" learning curve data.</abstract>
<description> An extension of models such as AFM. Added factor of time inspired by cognitive models of memory. The LRT model simply adds time between opportunities as a factor. DASH models are taken from Michael Mozer and Robert Lindsey's work incorporating cognitive theories into big data approaches. There is an option to use the memory factor as either a fixed effect or as a random slope on items (KCs).</description>
