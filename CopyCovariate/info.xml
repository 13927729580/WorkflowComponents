<abstract>CopyCovariate performs a features addition process over a tab-delimited datafile. This component can effectively add new produced features into the previous datafile</abstract>
<details>This compoment can pass new feature (CF..Corvariate.) to the previous datafile following each Anon Student Id automatically. So the output datafile is added with one more column (new feature). Email the author directly with bug reports for this component.</details>
