# LearnSphere and Tigris

[LearnSphere](LearnSphere.org) is co-developed by the [LearnLab](http://learnlab.org) â€“ a flagship project of [Carnegie Mellon](http://cmu.edu)'s [Simon Initiative](https://www.cmu.edu/simon). It is community software infrastructure for sharing, analysis, and collaboration of/around educational data. LearnSphere integrates existing and new educational data infrastructures to offer a world class repository of education data. 

[Tigris](https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/LearnSphereLogin) is a workflow authoring tool which is part of the community software infrastructure being built for the LearnSphere project. The platform provides a way to create custom analyses and interact with new as well as existing data formats and repositories.

# AFM and AFM+S in Python

This is a python implementation of the Additive Factors Model (Cenn, 2009) and
The Additive Factors Model with Slipping Paramters (MacLellan et al., 2015).
Wherever possible I tried to maintain scikit-learn convention, so that the code
would be compatible with their helper functions (e.g., for cross validation).

custom\_logistic.py is an estimator that can be used to implement AFM.
bounded\_logistic.py is an estimator that can be used to implement AFM+S.

process\_datashop.py can be used to read a student step or transaction export
from [DataShop](https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/) and to run AFM and AFM+S on
it. Alternatively, the data can be passed to the scripts as long as it adheres
to the [tab-delimited DataShop
format](https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/help?page=importFormatTd).This script
can be called with the -h argument to get details on supported arguments. By
default the script runs AFM+S when passed a student step export from Datashop;
e.g., `$ python process_datashop.py student_step_datashop_export.txt`

plot\_datashop.py can be used to plot student learning curves with the learning
curves predicted by AFM and AFM+S. Similar to process\_datashop.py, it accepts
student step files in datashop format; e.g.,
`$ python plot_datashop.py student_step_datashop_export.txt`

For a slightly more detailed example of how to use these scripts see my
[blog post](http://christopia.net/blog/modeling-student-learning-in-python).

# Appendix A. Technical Details 
## I. Dependencies

1. Ant 1.9 or greater
2. Java Enterprise Edition Software Development Kit (J2EE SDK)
2. Eclipse or Cygwin.
3. Clone the GitHub repository using `git clone https://github.com/PSLCDataShop/WorkflowComponents WorkflowComponents` command.
4. BKT contains executables which may need to be rebuilt for your system.
	- From the command-line in `WorkflowComponents/AnalysisBkt/program/standard-bkt-public-standard-bkt` folder issue the `make`command.
	- Then, copy the predicthmm.exe and `trainhmm.exe` to the `AnalysisBkt/program` directory.


## II. Documentation

See `WorkflowComponents/Workflow Components.docx` for detailed information on creating, modifying, or running components.

## III. Testing a workflow component in Eclipse, Cygwin, or Linux

### A. Eclipse
	
1. File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace.
2. Choose any component directory from your newly imported git clone, i.e. `WorkflowComponents/<AnyComponent>`.
3. Click 'Finish'.
4. In the Ant view (Windows -> Show View -> Ant), add the desired component's build.xml to your current buildfiles, e.g. `<AnyComponent>/build.xml`.
5. Double click the ant task `runToolTemplate`. The component should produce example XML output if it is setup correctly.

**NB**: For debugging, you may wish to add the jars in the directory `WorkflowComponents/CommonLibraries` to your build path.


### B. Cygwin or Linux

1. Change to your `WorkflowComponents` directory, e.g. `/cygdrive/c/your_workspace/<AnyComponent>/`
2. Issue the command `ant -p` to get a list of ant tasks
3. Issue `ant runComponent` to run the component with the included example data


## IV. Building components

### Build all components

Modify the `dir` variable in `WorkflowComponents/build.sh` to match your `WorkflowComponents` path, then run the script (requires bash)

### Building a single component

Issue the `ant dist` command.
