<abstract>The <b>Performance Factors Analysis</b> (PFA) performs a logistic regression over the "error rate" learning curve data.</abstract>
<description>PFA is a generalization of the additive factors model (AFM). It is a specific instance of logistic regression, with student-success (0 or 1) as the dependent variable and with independent variable terms for the student, the KC, the KC by prior succesful opportunity interaction and the KC by prior unsuccessful opportunity interaction. Without the KC by opportunity interactions, PFA is LLTM. Further, if the KC Model is the Unique-Step model (and there are also no opportunity counts), the model is a version of Item Response Theory, or the Rasch model. The version here is slightly different than the published version (Pavlik, Cen, &amp; Koedinger, 2009), since this version uses random effects for KC and student, which likely improves the model fit and the ability to identify the parameters with learning specific effects(Yudelson, Pavlik, &amp; Koedinger, 2011).</description>
