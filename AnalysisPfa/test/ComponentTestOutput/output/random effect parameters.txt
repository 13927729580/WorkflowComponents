KC..Cluster..0 A distribution describes the likelihood that observations will occur within any range of values.	-0.0776225373810834
KC..Cluster..1 A normal distribution, the most common natural distribution, is symmetric, so for example, the probability of observing a value in the range between -1 and 0 is equal to the probability of the range between 0 and 1.	-0.32564607270019
KC..Cluster..10 The normal distribution has 99.7 percent of its observations in the range between -3 and 3 standard deviations from the mean.	0.556239513409654
KC..Cluster..11 The sample mean, or average, is a statistic that represents what we expect observations in the sample to be centered around.	0.35023581431293
KC..Cluster..12 The standard deviation is a statistic that describes typical variability for a set of observations.	-0.308754934481458
KC..Cluster..13 The units for the standard deviation statistic are the same units used to measure the observations.	-0.20876606006907

KC..Cluster..22 Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, also known as root mean squared error.	-0.567968918109739
