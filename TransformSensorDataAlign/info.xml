<abstract>The <b>Sensor Data Align</b> component performs alignment of two sensor data and interpolate as required to match the output sampling rate.</abstract>
<description>Sensor Data Align component accepts two tab delimited sensor raw sensor data input. The user needs to specify the sampling rate of these inputs. User can also specify if there is any offset (in seconds) of sensor data 2 from sensor data 1. The interpolation algorithm will resample both input data to the output sampling rate. The user can select an interpolation algorithm from a list of 3 algorithms: spline, linear, and constant. The user can also generate a time vector, which will be added at the first column in the output file.</description>

<inputs>
<b>tab-delimited</b>
</inputs>

<outputs>
<b>tab-delimited</b>
<b>Alignement of two sensor data</b>
</outputs>

<options>
<b>Signal 1 Column Name</b> - Choice of the sensor column from input file1 for alignment<br/>
<b>Signal 1 sampling rate</b> - The sampling rate of the Signal 1 (Sensordata from file1)<br/>
<b>Signal 2 Column_Name</b>- Choice of the sensor column from input file2 for alignment<br/>
<b>Signal 2 sampling rate</b> - The sampling rate of the Signal 2 (Sensordata from file2)<br/>
<b>Offset of Signal2 from_Signal1</b> - The Signal 2 must be lagging behind the signal 1 and offset is how much time it lagging behind <br/>
<b>Output Resample rate</b> - The sampling rate of resulted output of two signal (sensor data)</br>
<b>Interpolation_Type</b> - Choice of interpolation type from where the data is being interpolated</br>
<b>Generate time vector</b> - Choice of generating a column for time sequence for ouput signal data</br>
<b>Input_Header</b> Is input header is going to be output header name
