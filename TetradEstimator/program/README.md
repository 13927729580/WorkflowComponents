readme

You have to give run.sh permission to run on the linux server.  do this with:
  "chmod ug+x run.sh"

run.sh is used on linux machines and runOnWindows.bat is used for windows

To run on a windows machine, change run.sh to runOnWindows.bat in the 
  build.properties file.  You'll also need to change the path to java
  and the path to other files inside of runOnWindows.bat.
