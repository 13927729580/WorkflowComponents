<abstract>The <b>Data Conversion</b> component implements a few of Tetrad's functions to manipulate data.

<description></description>

<inputs>
<b>tab-delimited</b> - Either a numerical dataset or (if Simulate_tablualr_from_covariance) a covariance matrix.
</inputs>

<outputs>
<b>tab-delimited</b>
</outputs>

<options>

  <b>Convert to Correlation Matrix</b> - This operation takes a tabular data set and outputs the lower half of the correlation matrix of that data set.<br/>

  <b>Convert to Covariance Matrix</b> - This operation takes a tabular data set and outputs the lower half of the covariance matrix of that data set.<br/>

  <b>Inverse Matrix</b> - This operation takes a covariance or correlation matrix and outputs its inverse. (Note: The output will not be acceptable in Tetrad as a covariance or correlation matrix, as it is not lower triangular.)<br/>

  <b>Simulate_Tabular_From_Covariance</b> - Input must be a covariance matrix.  Use Convert_to_Covariance_Matrix.  Option "Number of Intances" specifies how many rows should be in the output.<br/>

  <b>Whiten</b> - Takes a continuous tabular data set and converts it to a data set whose covariance matrix is the identity matrix.<br/>

  <b>Nonparanormal Transform</b> - Takes a continuous tabular data set and increases its Gaussianity, using a nonparanormal transformation to smooth the variables. (Note: This operation increases only marginal Gaussanity, not the joint, and in linear systems may eliminate information about higher moments that can aid in non-Gaussian orientation procedures.) <br/>

  <b>Standardize Data</b> - This operation manipulates the data in your data set such that each variable has 0 mean and unit variance.<br/>

  <b>Convert Numerical Discrete to Continuous</b> - If you choose this option, any discrete variables with numerical category values will be treated as continuous variables with real values. For example, “1” will be converted to “1.0.”<br/>
