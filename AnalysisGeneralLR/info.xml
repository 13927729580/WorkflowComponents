<abstract>General Logistic Regression (LR) Analysis performs among selected different features under different environment defined by specifying parameters of General LR models</abstract>
    
<details> This components used the classic Logistic Regression to analysis the different features from the learning data.Three parameters k,j and i are used for the creation of LR analysis environment. All the produced indators (Deviance Residuals, Coefficients, and Dispersion parameter et al.)and  are also recorded and output. <br/>

    <k>afmlog</k>-Here, k is defined as "afmlog" by default. Actually, the k can be selected from these following parameters like "afmline","afmlog","afmlogpowdec","afmpowdec","afmexpdec","propdec","logit","line","prop","log",and "expdec". <br/>
    <j>afmline</j>-Here,j is defined as "afmline" by default. Actually, the j can be selected from these following parameters like "afmline","afmlog","afmlogpowdec","afmpowdec","afmexpdec","propdec","logit","line","prop","log",and "expdec"<br/>
    <l>memory</l>-Here l is defined as "memory" by default. Actually, the l can be selected from these following parameters like "memory","exmcon",and "3level". <br/>
