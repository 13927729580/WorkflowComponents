<abstract>The <b>Solution Paths</b> component creates a visualization of the process students went through in order to solve a problem.  The nodes in the graph are the steps that they got to throughout the problem. The links show how many students took a particular path and the color of the link corresponds to the correctness of their responses from one step to the next.</abstract>
