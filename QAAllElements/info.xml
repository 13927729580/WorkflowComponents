<abstract>The <b>QA All Elements</b> component can be used to test all basic inputs and options of workflow components.</abstract>
<description>This component allows developers to test most of the basic inputs and options (including database connection) of workflow components to ensure that workflow core functions work.</description>

<inputs><ul>
<li>One input node that allows one file input and is required</li>
<li>One input node that allows one file input and is not required</li>
</ul></inputs>

<outputs>
Text file that displays all user selections for developers to verify. It also displays if database connection is established.
</outputs>

<options>
 <ul>
<li>String Type: simple text field</li>
<li>Selection List Type: can be long or short. This is to test dynamic options. This decided the next option: Long or Short Selection List to show</li>
<li>Long Selection List: only shows when "Selection List Type" selects "Long". This is to test the selection popup window.</li>
<li>Short Selection List: only shows when "Selection List Type" selects "Short". This is to test the short selection list that doesn't need a popup window.</li>
<li>Single File Selection List: this is to test single file input node. It also tests the selection list that should include headers from a particular node and a particular file. </li>
<li>Optional File Selection List: this is to test optional file input. It also tests the selection list that should include headers from all input files of all nodes. </li>
</ul>
</options>
