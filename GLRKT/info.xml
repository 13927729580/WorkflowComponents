<abstract>The <b>GKT</b> component is implements generalized knowledge tracing.</abstract>
<details>
    This <b>GKT</b> component has three modes, but crossvalidation has not been thouroughly tested and shoudl be considered experimental. The user enters up to as many as 10 4 valued terms, where each of the 4 values defines a linear regression predictor term. Examples:

    To produce standard AFM with random-effect intercepts:
    Term 1: intercept@; Anon Student Id; NA ; NA
    Term 2: intercept@; KC (Default); NA ; NA
    Term 3: lineafm$; KC (Default); NA; NA

    To produce standard PFA with random-effect intercepts:
    Term 1: intercept@; Anon Student Id; NA ; NA
    Term 2: intercept@; KC (Default); NA ; NA
    Term 3: linesuc$; KC (Default); NA; NA
    Term 3: linefail$; KC (Default); NA; NA

    To produce AFM with fixed-effect intercepts and long-term forgetting
    Term 1: intercept; Anon Student Id; NA ; NA
    Term 2: intercept; KC (Default); NA ; NA
    Term 3: base2$; KC (Default); NA,NA; .3,.05

  <p>
      <b>Type</b> - the user can select to find the best fitting model, or 5 times 2-fold cross-validation. 5 times 2-fold crossvalidation works only at the subject level (subject stratified) under the assumption that generalization to other subjects is what is desired. The user has the option to randomly create folds or to use the folds existing in a prior run of this component (i.e. if you feed the transaction file back into the analysis, you can choose read to use the exact same folds for a replication).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Term N</b> - The user can specify up to 10 terms</p>
