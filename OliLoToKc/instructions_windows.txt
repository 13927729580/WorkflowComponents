Need that php.ini file probably to make sure sqlite is loaded before hand. 
This might not be necessary depending on the system.
Contents of php.ini:
	extension_dir="C:\Program Files\PHP\php-7.2.8-Win32-VC15-x64\ext"
	extension=sqlite3

Run the php ini script to load sqlite3 
	php.exe --ini "C:\Program Files\PHP\php-7.2.8-Win32-VC15-x64\php.ini"
