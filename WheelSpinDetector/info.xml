<abstract>The <b>Wheel Spin Detector</b> component can detect which students are wheel spinning. The students who have consecutive three corrects are labeled as "false" for wheel spin. 
Students who didn't achieve 3 consecutive corrects within 10 opportunities are labeled true for wheel spin. Students who has less than 10 opportunities to determine wheel spin are labeled as undetermined.</abstract>
